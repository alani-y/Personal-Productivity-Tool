This is a browser extension I developed to help me manage my time more effectively. It creates time blocks that the user can set and displays a small banner in the 
corner that shows the current task the user wants to accomplish. After the time block is done counting, the banner will then ask if the user is done with the task, 
and then gives the option to either add 15 minutes to the time block or take a break. The break time is also set by the user. Then, the extension will cycle to
the next work block for the next listed tasl until the user is done with all task or quits the extension.
